# NonUniformRandomSelector
This repo contains a simple library that allows users to choose a random value from a list with different probabilities. The main reason for the existence of this repo is to find a better way that using the random class with a new array that have repetitive values of the same elements just to create the distribution from the elements. Although the functionality that the library provides may not be common, however, I found it useful to have it. The library can be imported from the jar files in jar.


<h1>Common Application</h1>
<h4>1- In proportinal selection in genetic algorithms.</h4>
<h4>2- In any application that requires a radnom element to be chosen nonuniformly.</h4>
